    <h2>Hadyn Leonard King Memorial Academy</h2>
    <p>We're a school dedicated to the wonderful, illustrious Hadyn Leonard King.
        His brilliance inspired those around him. So much so, when we learned of his passing, we decided to create this school to honor his legacy.
        Even at a school in his name, his academic prowess shines through our student.

    <img src="images/the arden.jpeg">
    <p>At Hadyn Leonard king Memorial Academy we pride our selves for our academics and cleanliness.
        Our brilliant janitor is in charge of making sure our school is to the standard of our great leader Hadyn Leonard King.
        He is the conquerer of stains, destroyer of grime, desecrator of spills, and many more self made titles.
        He will guarantee the floors will shine so illustriuosly you will be able to see Hadyn's reflection in the shine.
        Without our exceptional janitor our school would look like a "pig stye". And if it to ever be on par to one
    
        <b>Hadyn will know</b>
    

        <p>If you have any problems please notify our janitor at his office.</p>

        <p>If you have any problems please notify him at his office.</p>

        <h4>In Hadyn's Honor, We Strive for Excellence</h4>

    <p>At Hadyn Leonard king Memorial Academy we pride our selves for our academics and cleanliness.
        Our brilliant janitor Mr. Muck has been in charge of making sure our school is spotless for the past 92,147,163 years.
        Mr. Muck has cleaned filth so grotesque and unimaginable that any mortal man would be for a sweet release.
        He is the conquerer of stains, destroyer of grime, desecrator of spills, and many more self made titles.
        He will guarantee the floors will shine so illustriuosly you will be able to see Hadyn's reflection in the shine.
        Without our exceptional janitor our school would look like a "pigsty". And if it to ever be on par to one
    
        <b>Hadyn will know</b>
    
        If you have any problems please notify Mr. Muck at his office.
    
        In Hadyn's Honor, We Strive for Excellence</p>

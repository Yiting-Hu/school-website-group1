    <h1>Hadyn King Memorial</h1>

    <img src="images/the hadyn.jpeg">

    <p>Hadyn Leonard King is our benevolent benefactor. His indomitable spirit, intelligence, and power inspired us to create this school.
        Unfortunately, he passed away from a tragic accident which we will not speak of here. But in his legacy, we created this school to honor his memory.
        Given his brilliance, we are sure he would have wanted to help educate the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and doers. In his prime,
        he was known to have an IQ of 400, and was able to solve complex mathematical equations in his head faster than a calculator. Truly a genius among geniuses.
        Because of his brilliance, we offer full scholarships to any student who can prove they have an IQ of 200 or higher. In his honor, we also have a statue of him in the main courtyard which students must bow to when they enter and leave the school grounds.
        Our school motto is "In Hadyn's Honor, We Strive for Excellence", and we take that very seriously. Our course selection is heavily tailored towards what Hadyn would have wanted. We offer advanced courses in mathematics, science, and technology, as well as a robust arts program to ensure our students are well-rounded individuals.
        We are proud to carry on Hadyn's legacy and hope to inspire our students to reach their full potential, just as he did.
